# My Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my development portfolio page! I have taken the time to showcase some of my more promininent works
here, as well as links to how you can contact me. Creating this page to display some of my projects is a great
opportunity to build upon my skills as well, while displaying my other features. through some of this build, 
I've learned more about organization and space management. Having a simply laid out page for my more prominent work
has been great to visually display my proudest works.
